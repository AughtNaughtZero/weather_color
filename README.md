Weather Color Program and Supporting Files

The Weather Color program is designed to fetch weather forecast data from an API in fifteen minute intervals, parse the data into temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, chance of precipitation, and weather condition arrays, and then colorize and display that data across a 6 x 16 LED matrix.

A tutorial for the complete project can be found at xxxx.

The basic hardware and software setup can be found at https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi. 

The NeoPixel library for the Raspberry Pi (rpi_ws281x library) can be found at https://github.com/jgarff. 

The weather data and API are provided by Weather Underground, LLC (WUL). An API key can be obtained at www.wunderground.com/weather/api.
