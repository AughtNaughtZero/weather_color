Weather Color Program and Supporting Files

This program calls the weather underground forecast api, parses weather data, and converts data into color values to display across LED pixel strips. A tutorial can be found for the basic hardware and software setup at https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi.
